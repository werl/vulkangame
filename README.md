#Vulkan Game
## About
### Why?
Simply put it is just playing around with the Vulkan graphics API. Ideally i will create a game with it, but until that 
time it is just for fun!
### What does it do?
Currently, nothing!
### What does it work on?
should work with anything that supports Vulkan and GLFW, but I'm building it on Windows 10 with vulkan 1.2.154.1 SDK.
